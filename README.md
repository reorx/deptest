# Deptest


Deptest is a testing framework to handle situation when your need to control the execution order
of the test units. Seriously, deptest is not a unit testing framework, because it does not follow
the philosophy of unit testing, in other words, using this tool means you are thinking againest
“to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct”.

But so what? Programming needs diversity, so does testing methodology. If the situation really
exists, we shouldn't pretend not to see or force it into some sort of dogma, consider
solve it in another way is rational and reasonable.
